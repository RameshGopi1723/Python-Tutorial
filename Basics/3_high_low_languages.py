#High Level languages: These are the languages which are close to human languages. They are easy to learn and understand. They are user friendly. They are portable. They are independent of machine
#Low Level languages: These are the languages which are close to machine languages. They are difficult to learn and understand. They are not user friendly. They are not portable. They are dependent on machine.

#Interpreter: Converts high level language to machine language or low level language line by line. It is slow. It is easy to debug. It is easy to learn. It is used in Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, etc.
#Compiler: Converts high level language to machine language at once. It is fast. It is difficult to debug. It is difficult to learn. It is used in C, C++, Java, etc.

#Python is an interpreted language. It is easy to learn. It is easy to debug. It is slow. It is used in web development, data science, machine learning, etc.
#C is a compiled language. It is difficult to learn. It is difficult to debug. It is fast. It is used in system programming, game development, etc.

#interpreter finds the error in the code line by line. If there is an error in the code, interpreter stops the execution of the code and shows the error message. It is easy to debug the code in the interpreter.
#compiler finds the error in the code at once. If there is an error in the code, compiler stops the execution of the code and shows the error message. It is difficult to debug the code in the compiler.
